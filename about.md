###This is where I talk about myself in third person:

Anand Mani Sankar is a software architect by profession, and a coder at heart. He has spent most of his professional life building frameworks and enterprise applications for the desktop, mobile and web platforms. He has worked across technologies like C++, .Net, Java, Flex and is currently getting his hands dirty with Javascript. His interests mainly revolve around architecture and design, framework development, web technologies and analytics.

He is ever so fascinated by technology and loves keeping pace with it. Outside professional life, he spends time dabbling with various libraries, tools and platforms (that his full-time work doesn't permit using). He is also a gadget freak; Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno being his latest toys.
